# LoveApp

<b>First project in Android</b>, the purpose of it is to learn some basics of Android and to create an App for my girlfriend.
<br /><br />
The functionality are: <br />
1. A simple count of the time we have been together since we started to date. <br />
2. A map pointing out my location (hard-coded, to be improved), hers and the distance between us. <br />
3. A countdown till our next visit. (The idea is to make it tuneable, so she will be allow to update the date).
